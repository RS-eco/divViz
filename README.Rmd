## Overview

You are visiting the github repository of the divViz (Visualisation tool for biodiversity data) package. divViz is a shiny based [web app](https://rs-eco.shinyapps.io/divViz/) supporting interactive exploratory data analysis of simulated biodiversity data.

The main purpose of divViz is:

- Provide a toolbox for researchers to explore species & biodiversity data on the fly

This is what divViz looks like:

```{r, out.width = "90%", fig.align="center", fig.border = "none", eval=T, echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/divViz.png")
```
